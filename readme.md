Fork of scripthook trainer for watch dogs 2 with some implementation 
(I will always add more features, for now they are quite few)
You need to download the repo in .zip and put the files in <watchdogs>/bin/ScriptHook/data/scripts/trainer, then to open it in the game, press F4, if you have any suggestions to improve the trainer, make an issue.
